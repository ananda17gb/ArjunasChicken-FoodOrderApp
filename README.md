Our final project submission for data structure course final project where we were asked to make an app that implements linked list.
But for our flutter app project we don't think that we used linked list to make it but we already finished it so we might aswell just add it here so it didn't go to waste.

You can access the flutter app (the one without linkedlist) by cloning or downloading the __arjunaschiken__ folder, to access the terminal app you can clone or download the __restaurantFP__ folder, to access the flutter app (that uses single linkedlist) by cloning or downloading the __arjunaschikenmll__ folder and lastly to access the flutter app (that uses multi linked list that is converted from the terminal app to flutter) by cloning or downloading the __arjuna__ folder
